See below for the original README.

Sends Slack message every so often with important PRs to respond to.

This is an experimental effort to help with identifying the PRs that most need responses — initially breaking them up into two queues — one for those that have never seen a response from core maintainers and those that have had commits since the last comment so need a new review.

The goal is make sure every contributor has a great experience and to prevent valuable PRs from not getting in.

## Setup

`yarn install`

Change the slack channel ID to point to your own personal channel while experimenting (find that by [opening up slack in the web](https://gatsbyjs.slack.com) and copying the ID looking thing.

If testing changes, you can also write out the GitHub API response to a file called data.json and then change code in `process-data.js` to load
that file instead of waiting for API response from `index.js`. This speeds up iteration on design.

You can test the output by copy/pasting the CLI output to https://api.slack.com/tools/block-kit-builder
